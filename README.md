# Premier League Forecast

## Overview

Premier League Forecast is a web application that uses standard analytical data to predict the scoreline for upcoming Premier League fixtures. The application is built using:

- **Flask (backend)**
- **MongoDB (database)**
- **React (frontend)**

## Features

- Predict the scoreline for upcoming Premier League fixtures, including other statistics such as goal distributions.
- View detailed statistics for each Premier League team, such as attack rating, defense rating, and more.
- Very interactive, professional, and user-friendly UI that functions properly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Real-time data updates that can highlight the very next fixture in the current Premier League season.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Flask (Python) was used for the backend since the scope of the project is relatively small and Python offers tons of modules for scraping and data analysis.
- **Database**: MongoDB was used as the database because of its ease of use and NoSQL schema allowing for experimentation and manipulation of how data is stored.
- **Frontend**: React (Vite) was used as the frontend since its ease of use and overall flexibility can allow for future expansions for the application.

## Installation

To use/test the application, make sure you have these installed:

- Python (>= 3.8)
